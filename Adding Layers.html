        <h1>Adding Layers</h1>
        
        <p>Adding different layers of drawing will help the drawings move around.
           It's kind of like a flipbook, where you draw many scenes and you pile
           the papers in order and then you flip them to see the illusion of the 
           movements. One second for an animation equals to 24 scenes, so you 
           will need to have a team to complete an episode. You also need to color
           and shade each layer to have a full, colorful episode that people will 
           enjoy.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Sketch the layer to know what you'll be drawing.</li>
            <li>Add a layer on top of the sketching layer, make the sketch light, 
                and draw the lineart over the sketch.
            </li>
            <li>Fill the lineart with colors to show off what the drawing is.</li>
            <li>Lock the layer of the color to add in some shading to the drawing
                with some shadows from where the sun is shining.
            </li>
        </ol>
