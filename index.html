     <h1>Practice Drawing</h1>
    <p>
      The first step into becoming an Animator is to learn how to draw. 
       You will need to learn how to draw people like their body parts, some backgrounds, 
       and objects. These drawing practices can be learned by teachers in classes or tutorials
       from people on the internet. But you can't learn in one day, you will need to have
       time and practice to make the drawings look like they can move.
